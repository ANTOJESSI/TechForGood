#PROBLEM STATEMENT AND DESCRIPTION

Climate change, primarily fueled by the overuse of fossil fuels, poses a severe threat to the planet. Cities and industries must transition to renewable energy to curb emissions, but this shift can be difficult to plan due to factors like geography, infrastructure, and energy demands. At the same time, unemployment continues to be a major challenge, particularly in areas undergoing economic change. There is a need for a solution that not only supports a smooth transition to clean energy but also addresses job creation, helping to mitigate the impact ofÂ unemployment.
